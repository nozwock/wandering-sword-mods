### Installation
- Install a non-pre-release version of [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-installation) for the game
- **Optional:** Set the game's engine version in _UE4SS-settings.ini_ (If you don't, the initial load will take some time figuring out the game's engine version instead)
- Put the mod folder in the _Mods/_ folder
